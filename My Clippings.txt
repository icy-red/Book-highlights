Find something that your body likes to do and let your body do it. Let your body do it because it deserves as much as any other body in the world to shake itself to the rhythm of the beat, to plunge into the roiling waves and surf itself in to shore, to drape itself in beautiful colours, to stride through a crowded room and announce itself with confidence rather than apology, to be kissed, to be touched, to fuck and be fucked, to run, to be nourished and fed, to rollerskate in teeny-tiny shorts, to recline, to sleep, to be at peace. All bodies are good bodies, and that includes yours.

around 90 per cent less than the fees of managed funds — and yet AFIC outperforms the majority of these funds. (Kind of strange, isn't it? You pay more for these other funds and get less … that's quite often the way in the financial world.) And once you've got your toes wet with AFIC, you can start building your portfolio. My investment newsletter, the Barefoot Blueprint, has helped thousands of people — young, old, rich and poor — successfully begin building and growing their own investment portfolios. The hardest thing about investing is actually starting.

Feminists are not out to get us. They’re out to get the patriarchy. They don’t hate men, they hate The Man. They’re our mates. The patriarchy was created for the convenience of men, but it comes at a heavy cost to ourselves and to everyone else.

This effect is called self-efficacy. Trying new things—like writing a book, or exploring polyamory—involves learning new skills, and research shows that key to learning new skills is simply believing you can learn them. Self-efficacy in poly relationships is the feeling that you can make it through your wife's first date. That you'll figure out a way to manage your jealousy, even if you don't know how yet.

But if you happen to be a man, sometime in the future, and you’ve made it this far, please remember: you will never be subjected to the temptation of feeling you must forgive, a man, as a woman. It’s difficult to resist, believe me. But remember that forgiveness too is a power. To beg for it is a power, and to withhold or bestow it is a power, perhaps the greatest. Maybe none of this is about control. Maybe it isn’t really about who can own whom, who can do what to whom and get away with it, even as far as death. Maybe it isn’t about who can sit and who has to kneel or stand or lie down, legs spread open. Maybe it’s about who can do what to whom and be forgiven for it. Never tell me it amounts to the same thing.

They hate niggers too!’ As I lay on my bed, I wondered whether Thom and Flavis and Rachel were also watching this news report.

Here’s a question Taylor suggests asking yourself to help figure out if your concerns about comfort are just about comfort, not about internalized weight stigma: If you were able to do all the things you want to do with your body (climb stairs without getting winded, stop having knee pain, and so on) and never lose a single pound, would that be OK with you?

Because when diet culture makes us feel uncomfortable in our own skin, the solution to feeling better is never going to be the one that diet culture prescribes. Imagine that someone stole your identity, then offered to sell it back to you—that’s what diet culture does. It steals your sense of self, then sells it back to you in the form of diets, “programs,” “protocols,” and “plans” that will supposedly make you feel great about yourself, but that leave you feeling only worse in the end.

Some parents discourage their child’s agency and autonomy through comments or suggestions that insinuate, whether subtly or overtly, that the child is incapable, less than or not enough in some way. Even well-intentioned parents can question their children’s actions and decisions in ways that are shaming instead of encouraging. Some parents who are struggling with their own anxiety can easily get overwhelmed by children who want to explore and discourage or overprotect the child in ways that undermine their interests or abilities.

When people are compulsively and constantly pulled back into the past, to the last time they felt intense involvement and deep emotions, they suffer from a failure of imagination, a loss of the mental flexibility. Without imagination there is no hope, no chance to envision a better future, no place to go, no goal to reach.

Our relationship maps are implicit, etched into the emotional brain and not reversible simply by understanding how they were created. You may realize that your fear of intimacy has something to do with your mother’s postpartum depression or with the fact that she herself was molested as a child, but that alone is unlikely to open you to happy, trusting engagement with others.

I’ve found in my private practice that the one thing that feels worse than setting boundaries, is the need to legitimize them once we set them. If your boundaries have been really permeable in the past, it’s easy to fall into the trap of over-explaining as you firm them up, even in situations that are not high conflict.

Boundary shenpa is the result. Being in our feels about setting or holding a new boundary is so uncomfortable, we go into our headspace instead. And start intellectualizing the whole process to ourselves and the person with whom we are setting the boundary. This prevents us from being authentic with ourselves and with others.

What if we all became committed to the idea that no one should have to apologize for being a human in a body?

The place where Charis works is called Radiance. It sells crystals of all kinds, big and small, made into pendants and earrings or just raw, and seashells; and essential oils imported from Egypt and southern France, and incense from India, and organic body creams and bath gels from California and England, and sachets of bark and herbs and dried flowers, from France mainly, and Tarot cards in six different patterns, and Afghan and Thai jewellery, and tapes of New Age music with a lot of harp and flute sounds in them, and CDs of seashores, waterfalls, and loon calls, and books on Native Indian spirituality and Health Secrets of the Aztecs, and mother-of-pearl inlaid chopsticks and lacquered bowls from Japan, and tiny carvings of Chinese jade, and recycled handmade-paper greeting cards with arrangements of dried weeds stuck onto them, and packets of wild rice, and non-caffeine teas from eight different countries, and necklaces of cowries, dried plant seeds, polished stones, and carved wooden beads. Charis remembers this place from the sixties. It was called The Blown Mind Shoppe then, and had hash pipes and psychedelic posters and roach clips and tie-dyed undershirts and dashikis. In the seventies it was called Okkult, and had books on demonology, as well as on women’s ancient religions and Wicca and the lost kingdoms of Atlantis and Mu, and some unappealing bone artefacts, and smelly – and in Charis’s opinion, fraudulent – bundles of ground-up animal parts. There was a stuffed alligator in its window then, and for a while it even sold fright wigs and horror makeup kits, with fake blood and glue-on scars. That was a low point for it, although popular with the punk set. It changed again in the early eighties. That was when Shanita took over, when it was still Okkult. She quickly got rid of the stuffed alligator and the bones and the demonology books – why borrow trouble, she says, and she didn’t want any run-ins with the animal-rights folks, or any Christian weirdos spray-painting the window. It was her idea to start up the crystals, and to change the name to Radiance.

maintaining the primacy of the individual-lifestyle focus—without being transparent about larger influences—is an affront to people living in disadvantage, as it reduces their ill health to poor “choices” and blames them, all the while contributing to the stigma and judgmental thinking that fuels their oppression, worsens their health, and expands the health divide between the advantaged and disadvantaged.

On the basis of Myth 6, most medical and government health recommendations (not to mention innumerable corporate initiatives, ad campaigns, and even reality TV shows) focus on the need for individual change to improve public health, when what’s really needed if people are to live better and longer is social change. At the same time, it’s important to remember that looking after ourselves can influence our well-being, and that we must support people in finding ways to respond to their needs. There’s clearly a place for self-care along with collective efforts to advance equality.

HAES does not claim that everyone is at a healthy weight. What it does do is ask for respect and help people shift their focus away from changing their size to enhancing their self-care behaviors—so they let weight fall where it may naturally. It also keeps the role of lifestyle as a risk factor for disease in perspective.

HAES is often called “an alternative to dieting.” It is that, but HAES has much deeper goals. To offer a detour from self-blame and a lifestyle focus for health, HAES seeks to loosen the grip that dieting holds on popular imagination. That is why it requires us to step back and consider underlying factors in our worldview, so we don’t inadvertently reinforce the very structures we’re trying to transform.

Some people find that doing any record keeping at all where physical activity is concerned leaves a bad taste in the mouth, making them feel as though they are being judged or graded on their performance when they just want to be able to enjoy moving their bodies without pressure. If that describes you, don’t panic. You don’t have to keep written records, or any records at all, in order to be able to notice over time that movement is becoming easier, that you are feeling stronger, that you’re more comfortable in your body, and all that good stuff.

Doctors didn’t think of the surgery as a “medically necessary” intervention with a potential market of millions of people, the way they do today. But one physician—a bariatric surgeon named Howard Payne—saw things differently. In an effort to expand his practice, Payne coined the term morbid obesity. It was an ingenious way to frame bariatric surgery as a necessary and even lifesaving intervention, because labeling people’s body size as morbid makes it sound like they’re about to drop dead.

unwittingly allied themselves with diet culture. Because food-activist arguments generally focus not on cutting calories or fat but on food politics, public health, and eating (often delicious) locally produced food, however, the alliance with diet culture might not be obvious at first glance. The movement’s anti-food-industry sentiment has distracted people from the fact that by and large, food activists have built their case for changing the food system on a foundation of weight stigma, which directly benefits the weight-loss industry and harms everyday people, particularly those in larger bodies. There are other distractions, too: Pollan, Nestle, and other prominent food activists are public intellectuals rather than, say, doctors, “wellness influencers,” or personal trainers, which makes their books seem more like cultural touchstones than diet books—even though in many ways the latter is exactly what they are. Moreover, food activism ignores the fact that the roots of our cultural preference for thinness and weight loss are planted in the racist hierarchy of bodies created by nineteenth-century evolutionary biologists.

He began to realize that the “food as medicine” prescription could be worse than whatever ailment these patients were trying to manage. “I eventually came to regard food allergy treatment as the equivalent of a dangerous medication, one that should be prescribed only sparingly,” he later wrote.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, after Bratman published articles and eventually a book about the phenomenon, the medical community began to recognize orthorexia as a very real form of disordered eating—one that fixates on the supposed health and purity of food as opposed to its calorie content.

When you get cold, you shiver. That’s how your body keeps you warm so that you can survive. And when you’re restricted or deprived of food, your body turns up the food-seeking signals because it wants you to survive. It pumps out the hunger hormones, turns down the fullness hormones, and lowers your metabolic rate, all in the service of keeping you from starving. This isn’t a failure of your mind to control your body; this is your body taking care of you.

For the overwhelming majority of people, therefore, intentional weight loss is going to result only in weight cycling. As neuroscientist and author Sandra Aamodt puts it, “Almost all dieting is yo-yo dieting.”24 And from all the research we’ve just discussed, we know that yo-yo dieting negatively affects people’s health. So it truly is a vicious cycle: people pursue weight loss in a bid to improve their health, only to put it at greater risk; then, if they develop health problems, they’re told to lose weight to cure them.

The myth of exceptionalism has always been a cornerstone of neoliberal philosophy—the idea that since a few people can “make it” under capitalism, then everyone else can too. It is a myth that conflates the success of an individual with the prosperity of their entire class, and it is used to hide the barriers of systemic discrimination and violence.

For Quetelet, “this average man was hardly the ‘average’ (read ‘mediocre’) that is our present connotation.

Its rallying cry, love your body, presumes that our greatest challenges are internal, a poisoned kind of thought about our own bodies. It cannot adapt to those of us who love our bodies, but whose bodies are rejected by those around us, used as grounds for ejecting us from employment, healthcare, and other areas of life.

When I use the term masked Autism, I’m referring to any presentation of the disability that deviates from the standard image we see in most diagnostic tools and nearly all media portrayals of Autism. Since Autism is a pretty complex and multifaced disorder, that covers a lot of different traits, which can manifest in many different ways. I’m also talking about any Autistic person whose suffering wasn’t taken seriously for reasons of class, race, gender, age, lack of access to health care, or the presence of other conditions.

Of course, the very idea that certain Autistic people function more highly than others, or that functioning status is a binary quality you can catch at a glance, is problematic in its own right. That kind of thinking leads to many of us having our disabilities erased, and the private suffering that makes public “functioning” possible is ignored. It also perpetuates the idea that the only disabled lives worth living are those that can still manage to be productive or impressive in some conventional way.

Not recycling for a time will have an extremely small impact on the world, but not caring for your cat will have a huge impact on your cat.

The Fool wants you to be spontaneous. Book a vacation, quit your job, apply for a dream job seemingly out of your league. Leave your partner, take a lover, leave your lover, ask someone to marry you. Run away to another country for a while, or hop a train and write a book about it. Open a store, start a nonprofit, get pregnant. If it is bathed in optimism and takes you into unknown territory, the Fool wants you doing it. If you’re an outdoorsy type and do want to conquer the next big physical adventure, climb Everest or whatever, okay, fine, do it. Do it knowing the earth itself has got your back.

In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you’ll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to make it satisfying.
